Baby Name Popularity Model
==========================

About
-----

This is the repository for the work involved in Harvard's Fall 2018 Applied Math
115: Mathematical Modeling first project. It details the modeling process
alongside numerical experiments and theoretical work.

The project aims to model the evolution of baby name popularity over time in the
United States. The explicit aims are to 

1. Create a stylized model which fits baby names trends reasonably well through
   which to understand what drives baby name trends.
2. To potentially be able to use such a model for prediction of future baby name
   popularity.

Work Log

### Wednesday Oct 25

Francisco and Mark met at office hours to settle on a topic idea. The search was
motivated by availability of data as well as transferability of models we have
seen in class. They arrived at baby names as a rich source of data for which
diffusion models could be applicable.

### Thursday Oct 25

Present in class.
